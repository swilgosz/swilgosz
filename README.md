👋 Hi There!

My name is Seb and I'm a passionate Ruby developer and productivity madman.

### About me

I am a Ruby developer, owner of [Hanami Mastery](https://hanamimastery.com) initiative and a host of [content_for :devs](https://www.contentfor.dev) podcast, a coffee lover and blogger.

My mission is to **make Open-Source contributions attractive enough for developers to treat them as the main job**.

I am working on tutorials, [courses](https://www.udemy.com/user/sebastian-wilgosz/), [guides](https://hanamimastery.com), [articles](https://hanamimastery.com/c/stray), and [videos](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC4Z5nwSfZrUO4NI_n9SY3uQ) to help people stay in the environment they LOVE, even though it's sometimes hard when projects grow.

### Supporting my work

🙏 If you want to work with [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org), or in any other Ruby environment that has no issues with scalability, [a monthly contribution to my work](https://github.com/sponsors/swilgosz) would mean A WHOLE LOT. Even though working on Open-Source is not profitable too much, **I'm giving away at least 10% of anything I get in any way** to support other Open-Source contributors. [By helping me, you'll help others too](https://hanamimastery.com/about).

💻 Your support allows me also to **contribute to Open-Source projects as a coder.**
